# Installation and activations errors

## Error 1: Cannot access file (used by another process)

```bash
The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (os error 32)
```

This is usually a onedrive error. Onedrive is either updating the directory or indexing. Normally onedrive can cause a lot of similar headaches therefore its best to work away from Onedrive on a directory that is not being synced. If thats not possible, the close down onedrive - give it a minuite and try again.

## Error 2: ExecutionPolicy, cannot activate virtual enviornment
